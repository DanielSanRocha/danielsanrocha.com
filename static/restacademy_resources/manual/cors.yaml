name: The pesky CORS
text: 'CORS is a acronym to Cross-origin resource sharing, in a very brief manner, for security reasons when a page request
a resource in another domain (another base url) it is blocked by default. The the page that had their resources request
inform the browser that the third party page can access their resources is through a header called CORS. <br><br>

How your api probably will live in another domain (http://localhost:5000 for example) it will need to set a CORS
header in the response so the browser can allow this webpage to access your API. If all this was very confusing
what you need to know is that you will not have CORS problem if you set your API to set the header <br><br>
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```<br><br>
in every response. Never do this in a production environment for obviously reasons. <br><br>


A way to easily do this if you are using flask is to install flask-cors with the command <br><br>
```
pip install -U flask-cors
```<br><br>

And adding this snippet just after you declare the ''app'' global variable<br><br>
```
from flask_cors import CORS;
CORS(app)
```<br><br>

Most of frameworks and languages have a easy way of setting up CORS so search around and see what you can find =).
